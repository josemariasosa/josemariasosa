### Hi there ü¶° Let me introduce myself.

My name is Jos√© Mar√≠a. I was born in M√©xico üá≤üáΩ. I took my first programming class when I was 15 years old (in 2003) and it was in `TURBO PASCAL`. The [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) is my favorite game ever since then.

During my first year in university, I had two classes of basic and advance `C/C++` where I learned most of the programming fundamentals. However, I didn't really use the language. Instead, for mathematics and engineering, I worked with `MATLAB`.

My major is in Industrial Engineer. I worked as a consultant in multiple Lean Six-Sigma projects for different manufacturing companies in the food industry (Hershey's üç´ and Driscolls üçì) and in the automotive industry (Precom, Dina trucks, Crown lift trucks). Also, in the logistics and transportation industry with a full time job in Potosinos Express üöõ..

I wanted to study more about Statistical Modeling, so I decided to pursuit a Master of Science degree in Quality Systems. During those years, I first encountered open-source projects, specially [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). I graduated with the thesis: **Creating a framework for Design of Experiments in R**.

In late 2016, I started working as a Data Scientist. First, I learned `Bash` in order to automate most of my day-to-day tasks. I got in love with Linux. Blockchain runs in Linux üêß, everything does. Then, I adopted `Python` as my principal working tool.

This is a list of the coolest public repositories I've been working on:

- [**Rubik**](https://github.com/josemariasosa/rubik): A compilation of very useful functions, a workflow in `Pandas`, when you are dealing with weird and nested Dataframes. Specially when you need to import/export NoSQL, JSON-type data into tables.
- [**Nuit-BTC Wallet**](https://github.com/josemariasosa/nuit-btc): A cryptographically secure implementation of a Bitcoin Wallet that allows you to generate, or import, a set of mnemonic words (BIP-39). Get a pair of Extended Keys (BIP-32). And derive all of your addresses based on the Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet structure (BIP-44, BIP-49, BIP-84).
- [**Jomtools**](https://github.com/josemariasosa/jomtools): Personal cheat sheet.
- [**Music Theory**](https://github.com/josemariasosa/music-theory): A reference book, I'm still working on, for the music theory of the guitar and bass guitar instruments.
