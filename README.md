### Hi there ü¶°

Let me introduce myself.

My name is Jos√© Mar√≠a. I took my first programming class when I was 15 years old and it was in `TURBO PASCAL`. The [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) is my favorite game ever since then.

During my first year in university, I had two classes of basic and advance `C/C++` where I learned most of the programming fundamentals. However, I didn't really use the language for any other class. Instead, for mathematics and engineering, I used `MATLAB`.

My major is in Industrial Engineer. I worked as a consultant in multiple Lean Six-Sigma projects for different manufacturing companies, in the food industry (Hershey's and Driscolls) and in the automotive industry (Precom, Dina trucks, Crown lift trucks). Also, in the logistics and transportation industry with a full time job in Potosinos Express. 

I wanted to learn more about statistical modeling, so I decided to pursuit a Master of Science degree in Quality Systems. It was during those years that I started to learn more about open-source projects, specially [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). I graduated with the thesis: **Creating a framework for Design of Experiments in R**.
